# Project---NostalgiCalc
# Day24 of 30 days 30 projects challenge

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to NostalgiCalc, a cool little project I put together to bring back some vintage vibes to the world of calculators. You know, the good old days when calculators had that classic look and feel? Yeah, that's what NostalgiCalc is all about!

## What's Inside?
HTML: The skeleton of our calculator. It's where we structure everything and make sure it all makes sense.

CSS: This is what gives our calculator its style and that awesome retro look. Think of it like the calculator's fashion designer.

## Why NostalgiCalc?
I wanted to create a simple and stylish calculator using just HTML and CSS. No fancy frameworks or complicated stuffâ€”just good ol' web technologies.

Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute. Let's keep it simple and stylish! âœ¨
